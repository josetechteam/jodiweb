## My First Blog 
- using Jekyll

### How can i get organized?

~~~
for i in {1..365} ; \
	do echo "have more fun with kanban";  \
done
~~~

### How can I get more done?

### How can I have more fun?

### How can I excite my brain and be jazzed at work?


Today while I was driving in at 5 AM


I also had a great conversation with Mike Choate on national parks, navigation units and
selfie sticks - lots of laughs - need to add him to my virtual peer group.


## What about a virtual peer group?

### What if it had real people 
- people on the net 
- and authors that resonate

### Authors, thinkers, bloggers and philosophers

### These would be added to the kanBan people

The conversations we have dictate how we think.

How we think dictates what we do and what we want.

This can lead to happiness and productivity or sadness and distress.

### Personal Kanban !

### Just gotta say KANBAN is awesome for me 
- feeling organized and productive
- helps track state information

Looking at pesonal Kanban.
