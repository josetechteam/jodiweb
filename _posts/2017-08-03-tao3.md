## Tao Te Ching #3

> Putting a value on status will create contentiousness. If you overvalue possessions, people will begin to steal. But not displaying what is desirable, you will cause the people's hearts to remain undisturbed. The sage governs by emptying the minds and hearts, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones. Practice not doing ... when action is pure and selfless, everything settles into its own perfect place.


### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Notice today when you are about to buy something and ask whether this will truely lead to happiness


> My first time on an elevator was quite uplifting, but the second time was really a letdown.
