## Tao Te Ching #4

- The Tao is like a well:
- used but never used up.
- It is like the eternal void:
- filled with infinite possibilities.

- It is hidden but always present.
- I don't know who gave birth to it.
- It is older than God.

- The TAO is empty 
- But inexhaustible , 
- Bottomless, 
- The ancestor of it all. 
- Within it , 
- the sharp edges become smooth , 
- the Twisted knots loosen, 
- The sun is softened by a cloud, 
- the dust settles into place. 
- It is hidden but always present. 
- I do not know who gave birth to it. 
- It seems to be the common ancestor of all, 
- the father of things.


> Wisdom is knowing I am nothing.
Love is knowing I am everything .
And between the two my life moves.
<cite>Nisargadatta Maharaj</cite>



### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Try to not respond in every situation today
- What would my infinite being do to help/assist today
- Observe without judgement and ego.


> "Worry is transitory, 
It's simply part of the world of the changing.
If you view your life from the vantage point of the infinite Observer, concerns, anxieties, and struggles blend into the internal mix." 
<cite>Wayne Dyer</cite>

> How did the Hipster burn his lips? 
He drank his coffee before it was cool .
