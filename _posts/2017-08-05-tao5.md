## Tao Te Ching #5


- The Tao doesn't take sides;
- It gives birth to both good and evil.
- The Master doesn't take sides;
- She welcomes both saints and sinners.

- The Tao is like a bellows:
- It is empty yet infinitely capable.
- The more you use it, the more it produces;
- The more you talk of it, the less you understand.

- Hold on to the center.

> Heaven and Earth are impartial, they see the 10,000 things as Straw Dogs. The sage is not sentimental, he treats all his people as Straw Dogs. The sage is like having an earth, to him none are especially dear, nor is there anyone he disfavors, he gives and gives , without condition, offering his treasures to everyone. Between Heaven and Earth is a place like a bellows, empty and inexhaustible, the more it is used, the more produces. Hold on to the center. Man was made to sit quietly and find the truth within.


### CHAPTER 60:
- Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself. 


### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Practice engaging everyone with a fair mindset.


> "Offer your treasures to everyone"

 -- Because he doesn't want to be spotted .
