## Tao Te Ching #7

>The Tao is infinite, eternal.
Why is it eternal?
It was never born;
thus it can never die.
Why is it infinite?
It has no desires for itself;
thus it is present for all beings.

>The Master stays behind;
that is why she is ahead.
She is detached from all things;
that is why she is one with them.
Because she has let go of herself,
she is perfectly fulfilled.

>Heaven is eternal the Earth endures. Why do Heaven and Earth last forever? They do not live for themselves only. This is the secret of their durability. For this reason the sage puts himself last and so ends up ahead. He stays a witness to life, so he endures. Serve the needs of others, and all of your own needs will be fulfilled. Through selfness action, fulfillment is attained.

### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Look for ego demands today and diffuse as many as you can - also score your level of uncomfort each time you resist showing how YOU are special

> Never trust an atom --- they make up evrything.
