## Tao Te Ching #11
Living from the void.

> 30 spokes converge upon a single hub, it is on the hole in the center that the use of the cart hinges. 
Shape clay into a vessel, it is a space within that makes it useful. Carve fine doors and windows, but the room is useful in its emptiness. 


>We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use.


### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Notice the silence and space today
- Let go of your identity and any material things that define you
