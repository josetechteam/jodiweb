## Tao Te Ching #12
Living with Conviction!

- Colors blind the eye.
- Sounds deafen the ear.
- Flavors numb the taste.
- Thoughts weaken the mind.
- Desires wither the heart.

- The Master observes the world
- but trusts his inner vision.
- He allows things to come and go.
- His heart is open as the sky.


> The five colors blind eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste. The chase and the hunt craze people's minds. Wasting energy to obtain rare objects only impedes ones growth. The master observes the world but trusts his inner vision; allows things to come and go, he prefers what is within to what is without.

### Practicing the Tao - today:

- Contemplate the pure essence and awe within you today.
- Your essence alone is enough.



> For happiness,how little suffices for happiness! ... the least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest thing, a lizard's rustling, a breath, a whisper, an eye glance-little maketh up the best happiness. Be still.
<cite>Nietzche</cite>



> Why did the cannibals decline to dine at the country club? --- The can't stand tennis elbow!
