### TAO 17
Tao Te Ching #17

- When the Master governs, the people
- are hardly aware that he exists.
- Next best is a leader who is loved.
- Next, one who is feared.
- The worst is one who is despised.

- If you don't trust the people,
- you make them untrustworthy.

- The Master doesn't talk, he acts.
- When his work is done,
- the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!"


> With the greatest leader above them, people barely no one exists. Next comes one whom they love and praise. Next comes one whom they fear. Next comes one whom they despise and defy.



> When the leader trusts no one, no one trusts him. 



> The leader speaks little. He never speaks carelessly. He works without self-interest and leaves no Trace. When all is finished, the people say, "We did it ourselves!!!"


### Practicing the Tao - today:

> Even after all this time the Sun never says to the Earth, you owe me.

>Look what happens with a love like that, it lights the whole sky. 
<cite> Hafiz 14th century poet</cite>

- Simply be there to serve.
- Don't interfere with words, nod or gesture only.


> There's a fine line between a numerator and a denoinator.
