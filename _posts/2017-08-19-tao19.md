### TAO 19

Tao Te Ching #19

- Throw away holiness and wisdom - and people will be one hundred times happier

- throw away morality and justice and people will do the right thing

- throw away industry and profit and there won't be any thieves

- just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course,


> Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom, and it will be a hundred times better for everyone. Throw away morality and Justice and people will do the right thing. Throw away industry and profit and there will be no thieves.

> All of these outward forms alone, they are not sufficient in themselves. 

> It's more important to see the Simplicity, to realize one's true nature, to cast off selfishness and temper desire.

### Practicing the Tao - today:


- Trust your inner goodness!
- Don't evaluate yourself on accomplishments and accumulations.


> What do you call a bear with no teeth? -- A gummy bear!
