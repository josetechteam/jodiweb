### TAO 21:

- The Master keeps her mind
- always at one with the Tao;
- that is what gives her her radiance.

- The Tao is ungraspable.
- How can her mind be at one with it?
- Because she doesn't cling to ideas.

- The Tao is dark and unfathomable.
- How can it make her radiant?
- Because she lets it.

- Since before time and space were,
- the Tao is.
- It is beyond is and is not.
- How do I know this is true?
- I look inside myself and see.


> The greatest virtue is to follow the Tao in the Tao alone. The Tao is Elusive and intangible. Although formless and intangible, it gives rise to form. Although vague and Elusive, it gives rise to shapes. Although dark and obscure, it is the spirit, the essence, the life breath of all things.



> Throughout the ages, its name has been preserved in order to recall the beginning of all things. How do I know the ways of all things at the beginning? I look inside myself and see you what is within me.

### Practicing the Tao - today:


- live in the gap between your thoughts/thinking mind.
