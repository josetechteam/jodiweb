### TAO 24:

- He who stands on tiptoe
- doesn't stand firm.
- He who rushes ahead
- doesn't go far.
- He who tries to shine
- dims his own light.
- He who defines himself
- can't know who he really is.
- He who has power over others
- can't empower himself.
- He who clings to his work
- will create nothing that endures.

> If you want to accord with the Tao,
just do your job, then let go.

>If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go. 
and everything will fall into place. 


> If you stand on tiptoe, you cannot stand firmly. If you take long steps, you cannot walk far.

>Showing off does not reveal Enlightenment. Boasting will not produce accomplishment. He who is self-righteous is not respected. He who  brags will not endure.

> All these ways of acting are odious, distasteful. They are Superfluous excesses. They are like a pain in the stomach, a tumor in the body.

> When walking the path of the Tao, this is the very stuff that must be uprooted, thrown out, and left behind.

### Practicing the Tao - today:

> Cultivate an attitude of gratitude and clear away the weeds of bragging and boasting.

- Express kindness to someone; especially, someone who would be surprised.
