### TAO 31:

Tao 31


- content goes here

> this is a quote block


> A knower of the truth travels without leaving a trace, speaks without causing harm, gives without keeping an account. The door he shots, though having no lock, cannot be opened. The not heat eyes, though using no court, cannot be undone.



> Be wise and help all beings in partially , abandoning none. Waste no opportunities. This is called following the light.



> What is a good man but a bad man's teacher? What is a bad man but a good man's job? If the teacher is not respected and the student not cared for, confusion will arise, however clever one is. This is the great Secret.

### Practicing the Tao - today:

> Play rather than work, even while you're at your job! Giggle rather than maintaining a solemn air. Be in awe for a moment or two.
<cite>Wayne Dyer</cite>


> what do you call a Hobbit playing the fiddle? - Lord of the Strings
